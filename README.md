# YouDownload

Download music from youtube. This package creates a local web application that allows you to paste a Youtube url into the UI to extract the audio from a Youtube video.  The audio is subsequently saved in `$CWD/www/yd/songs/mp3/` where `CWD=$(pwd)` of the git repo on your local machine.
